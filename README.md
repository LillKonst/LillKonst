## Hi there! 
### My name is Lill and I am a Frontend Development student.
Currently an online student at *Noroff University*. 

I'm a creative at heart and I've been working as a professional dancer and dance teacher for the last 7 years. I love to move, create and convey stories and emotions on stage.  
I've resently fallen head over heels for the art of coding. Its refreshing to learn new things and challenge myself in new ways. My self-employed journey has given me a lot of dicipline and this has proven helpfull on this new and exciting journey. Soon, I will have completed the first year of my studies at Noroff University and Im excited to learn more and evolve my skills within Frontend Development. 


**Skills: JS / HTML / CSS**
