## Hi there! 
### My name is Lill and I am a Frontend Development student.
Currently an online student at *Noroff University*. 

I'm a creative at heart, but have recently fallen head over heels for the magic of coding. 
I've been working as a professional dancer and dance teacher for the last 7 years. My self-employed journey has given me a lot of dicipline and taught me to manage my time well. 
Soon, I will have completed the first year of my studies at Noroff University and Im excited to learn more and evolve my skills within Frontend Development. 


**Skills: JS / HTML / CSS**

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: konstlillkristine@gmail.com 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I live in a tinyhouse on wheels.
