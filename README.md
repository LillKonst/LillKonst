## Hi there! 
### My name is Lill and I am a Frontend Developer.
Recently graduated from a two year Frontend Development program at *Noroff University*. 

I'm a frontend developer based in Oslo, Norway. I love transforming ideas into visually appealing, user-friendly, and functional applications. My goal is to contribute to shaping a more harmonious way of interacting with the ever-evolving web.
Before diving into tech, I spent eight years as a professional dancer and dance teacher, a journey that taught me discipline, adaptability, and creative problem-solving. A decade in Oslo inspired a move to a tiny house on wheels, where living close to nature fuels my creativity and helps me maintain a healthy work-life balance.
In December 2024, I graduated from a two-year frontend development program at Noroff Vocational School. Iâ€™m excited to bring my creativity and dedication to this new career path and make a meaningful impact in the tech world.
